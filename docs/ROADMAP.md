# Sentinel Roadmap

Sentinel is a cross-platform Qt/QML personal AI assistant desktop app, optimized first for Linux/Fedora KDE Plasma.

## Phase 1: Foundation

Create the C++20/Qt project structure, core interfaces, local echo provider, runtime memory, mode handling, and documentation base.

## Phase 2: UI Shell Foundation

Build the QML desktop shell, dashboard, chat panel, memory/settings pages, view models, and local-only UX foundation.

## Phase 3: Persistence + Architecture Stabilization

Add settings persistence, SQLite key-value memory, dedicated chat history persistence, diagnostics, lifecycle controls, and AI context docs.

## Phase 3.4: Cross-platform Architecture Readiness

Completed. Prepared architecture for Linux, Windows, and macOS without implementing platform integrations yet.

Focus:

- Portable core boundaries.
- Linux/Fedora KDE optimized path.
- Future platform service interfaces.
- Controlled dependency growth.
- No Phase 4 implementation.

Delivered in this phase:

- Platform boundary interfaces (`IPathProvider`, `IPlatformService`, `INotificationService`,
  `ISystemIntegrationService`).
- Default Qt `QStandardPaths` path ownership through `StandardPathProvider`.
- Local storage maintenance controls for memory/chat with confirmation UX.
- Explicit separation preserved across settings, memory, and chat history.

## Phase 3.5: Pre-agent Architecture Audit and Release Checkpoint

Completed. Stabilization checkpoint before starting Phase 4 implementation.

Focus:

- Architecture consistency audit across core, view-model, persistence, platform boundaries, and QML exposure safety.
- Small safe fixes only (docs, naming, status wording, minor test gaps).
- Verification gate for tests and formatting.
- Explicit no-Phase-4-runtime rule.

Readiness criteria for Phase 4:

- Boundaries and persistence separation remain intact.
- QML exposure remains generic and safe.
- Verification commands and format checks pass.
- Known limitations are documented and unchanged.

Candidate interfaces:

- `IPlatformService`
- `IPathProvider`
- `INotificationService`
- `ISystemIntegrationService`

## Phase 4: Agent Core & Tool System

Started with Phase 4.0 minimal runtime boundary work.

### Phase 4.0: Agent Core Planning and Minimal Runtime Skeleton

Completed.

Delivered:

- `IAgentRuntime` boundary and request/response/status abstractions.
- Deterministic local `NullAgentRuntime` with no tool execution.
- Minimal controller/view-model agent status/placeholder request wiring.

Still out of scope:

- Real tool execution.
- Networking/API keys.
- Real provider integration.
- Plugin loading.
- Privileged or OS-level automation.

## Phase 5: Advanced UI/UX & Motion System

Evolve the Qt Quick experience with responsive layouts, adaptive themes, assistant-like interaction, animated panels, dashboard cards, and reusable components.

## Phase 6: Security / Sandbox / Permissions

Add permission models, auditability, sandboxing strategy, secret handling, and safe local automation constraints.

## Phase 7: Packaging / Ecosystem / Extensions

Prepare packaging, update channels, plugin/extension lifecycle, platform-specific integration packages, and distribution workflows.
