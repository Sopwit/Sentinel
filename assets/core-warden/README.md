# Core Warden CW-01

- `reference/Core_Warden_Original_Reference.png`: existing approved concept sheet; preserved.
- `scripts/build_cw01.py`: deterministic procedural mesh/material/stage builder.
- `scripts/validate_cw01.py`: reopen validation, independent mesh and RGBA checks.
- `blender/core_warden_cw01.blend`: editable master, no animation.
- `renders/preview/cw01_{front,three_quarter,side,back,hero}.png`: transparent 640px previews.

Run from the repository root:

```sh
/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender --background --python-exit-code 1 --python assets/core-warden/scripts/build_cw01.py
/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender --background assets/core-warden/blender/core_warden_cw01.blend --python-exit-code 1 --python assets/core-warden/scripts/validate_cw01.py
```

Use the installed Blender executable on other platforms. The builder clears its current scene and replaces generated CW-01 outputs: run in a fresh background process, not an unsaved user session. It never edits the reference. Source geometry remains low resolution; bevel modifiers are editable. Part origins sit at component bounds, while head/face centers are local. Each eye has its own Glacier material for independent emission animation. Animate object transforms directly; no armature or keyframes are included. The saved master uses Eevee for interactive preview; batch previews use CPU Cycles for headless portability. No runtime integration is included.

## CW-02 refinement

`blender/core_warden_cw02.blend` is a derivative opened from the existing CW-01 master. CW-01 files and previews remain unchanged. All 22 original object names are retained; head and face vertex coordinates remain intact. Armor and eyes are refined in place, with supporting detail added separately.

```sh
/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender --background --python-exit-code 1 --python assets/core-warden/scripts/build_core_warden_cw02.py
/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender --background assets/core-warden/blender/core_warden_cw02.blend --python-exit-code 1 --python assets/core-warden/scripts/validate_core_warden_cw02.py
python3 assets/core-warden/scripts/compare_core_warden_cw02.py
```

The comparison command needs Pillow. `renders/cw02/` contains five views, three native size tests, and the concept/CW-01/CW-02 comparison. The hero image has a dark opaque background; other rendered views are transparent. Preview settings: 640px, 24 CPU Cycles samples; saved viewport engine: Eevee.

`CTRL_Float` moves the complete mascot. `CTRL_HeadMotion` rotates the head, cheeks and rear assembly. `CTRL_LeftShell`, `CTRL_RightShell`, three `CTRL_Upper_Armor_*` controls and `CTRL_LowerV` provide independent local movement. Side liners and luminous trims follow their respective shells. On `CTRL_Float`, `eye_left_intensity`, `eye_right_intensity` and `accent_intensity` drive independent material emission. No keyframes, state animations or armature are included. Coordinates: +Z up, -Y forward.

The CW-02 builder replaces only its own derivative and renders; it opens CW-01 afresh each time and verifies baseline SHA-256 checksums. Run in a dedicated background Blender process, never an unsaved interactive scene. Local logs and `.blend1` backups are ignored; build/validation/readability JSON files record the checks performed. See the CW-02 refinement report for visual limitations and the approval boundary before CW-03.

## CW-02.1 visual polish

`blender/core_warden_cw02_1.blend` loads CW-02 and applies vertex-only polish. All 29 meshes, base topology, object names, pivots, parenting and eight controls are retained. Obsidian shader values and head/face mesh coordinates are unchanged. Lighting, fuller eye lenses, shell presentation, crown sweep and V readability are refined. Existing eye/accent controls remain available, with new default intensities.

```sh
/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender --background --python-exit-code 1 --python assets/core-warden/scripts/polish_core_warden_cw02_1.py
/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender --background assets/core-warden/blender/core_warden_cw02_1.blend --python-exit-code 1 --python assets/core-warden/scripts/validate_core_warden_cw02_1.py
python3 assets/core-warden/scripts/compare_core_warden_cw02_1.py
```

The comparison script requires Pillow. Outputs are in `renders/cw02_1/`: front, three-quarter and side at 512px, hero at 768px, and native 96px/128px front previews. All six are transparent RGBA. `comparison.png` composites these for review against CW-02 and the original concept. The saved master uses Eevee; static renders use 24 CPU Cycles samples. CW-01 and CW-02 are preserved and checked by SHA-256. No animations or runtime integration are included. See `docs/development/CORE_WARDEN_CW02_1_POLISH_REPORT.md` for validation and remaining differences.

## CW-03A animation production

`blender/core_warden_cw03a.blend` derives from CW-02.1 with three real eight-slot Actions: Idle (16 frames), Thinking (16) and Tool Running (12), all at 8 FPS. The 29 meshes and eight controls remain intact. `animations/manifest.json` lists 132 transparent PNGs across 96/128/192px. `previews/cw03a/approval.html` plays the three states at native sizes. Run the embedded `CW03A_select_state.py` helper to select a complete state or return to neutral. Build/export/package/validation commands, measured performance and approval limitations are in `docs/development/CORE_WARDEN_CW03A_ANIMATION_REPORT.md`. No TUI integration is included.

## CW-03B remaining states — visual review pending

`blender/core_warden_cw03b.blend` derives from CW-03A and adds Listening,
Processing, Approval, Speaking, Success, Warning and Error Actions while retaining
all prior masters and outputs. Open `previews/cw03b/approval.html` for all ten states
at native 96/128/192px; one-shots play once and hold their final neutral pose.
The seven new candidates are metadata-only: existing shared `states` mappings remain
unchanged. Use the CW03B build/export/package/validation scripts and see
`docs/development/CORE_WARDEN_CW03B_ANIMATION_REPORT.md` for reproduction and evidence.
An extended ten-state source catalog requires the compatible Rust asset validator;
do not replace the protected V4-B package's assets independently of its old binary.
No Voice/Agent/Desktop/TUI event integration or CW-05 is included.
